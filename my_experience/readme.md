# My Experience @ GNDEC

## Day 1
My first day at GNDEC started with all the CSE and IT students assembling in the auditorium. The atmosphere was calm, and the stage was beautifully decorated. After waiting for about 30 minutes, the host invited the first speaker, Harpreet Mam. Her lecture made us feel like we were already a part of the GNDEC family.

Our Principal Sir then motivated us to make the best use of this platform. The NSET Director introduced us to the illustrious history of this institution, emphasizing its 100 years of shaping brilliant minds. He highlighted the first 36 years, which were dedicated to establishing the institute.

I learned an essential lesson: “Seize the opportunity; don’t wait for it to come to you.”

Next, the ADGP Officer shared invaluable insights about karma and the delayed rewards of good deeds. He spoke from experience for about an hour without any preparation, which was impressive. One piece of advice that stood out was: “Don’t be easily impressed; there’s always more to learn.”

Students who interacted and spoke up received chocolates. In the end, I missed out on chocolates but gained countless lessons, some the hard way. I resolved never to miss an opportunity again.

## Day 2

A new opportunity arose thanks to Dr. Arvind Dhingra. He helped me shed my reserved behavior and start interacting with others. He asked for 11 boys and 11 girls to come up on stage. Determined not to miss any opportunity, I joined them. We played a team strategy game and introduced ourselves to our peers.

Then, Dr. H.S. Rai, the Controller of Examination, spoke. His perspective on examinations was fascinating, viewing them as opportunities to shine.

Unexpectedly, Dr. H.S. Rai sought 10 students to work with him – not for him. I felt it was divine intervention when I got selected to be part of this group, which eventually grew to 50 members. From the second day of college, we began learning the latest technologies, an opportunity rarely seen elsewhere.

## Day 3

We learned Excel and ChatGPT in an exciting, hands-on class workshop organized by the Causmic Club. Instead of making a normal Excel sheet and performing calculations manually, we tried to do it with commands. I enjoyed it so much that I gave a video feedback after the lecture.

Later, we had a math session. Initially, recalling all the formulas was challenging, but I eventually got the hang of it and enjoyed the class. Our lecturer, a young assistant professor, was interactive and understanding.

Some of us attended a meeting of the CodeGNE club, a group that had grown to 50 members on Telegram.

# Day 4 at CodeGNE: Embracing Leadership and Overcoming Challenges

## Introduction

Day 4 at CodeGNE has been an exciting and rewarding experience. As a B.Tech student in Information Technologies at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, I am always eager to enhance my skills and take on new challenges. Today was particularly special as I continued to grow in my role as a leader and tackled several technical tasks.

## Stepping into Leadership

One of the most significant milestones today was being officially appointed as the first leader of my group. This role is a recognition of my skills and dedication, and it provides a valuable opportunity to develop project management and team leadership skills. Leading a group of talented peers and coordinating with the other five leaders appointed in our team has been a rewarding experience.

## Technical Learnings and Challenges

Today's journey in CodeGNE has been a treasure trove of technical knowledge. Here are some key learnings and challenges I encountered:

1. **Mastering GitHub:** Operating GitHub properly has been a game-changer. From version control to collaborative coding, GitHub has streamlined our workflow and enhanced our productivity.
   
2. **Markdown Language:** Learning Markdown has been incredibly useful. It has simplified the process of formatting text, creating documentation, and maintaining readability across various platforms.

3. **Pandoc Installation and Usage:** One of the more challenging yet fulfilling experiences was installing and using Pandoc. Despite facing initial difficulties, I was able to overcome them through perseverance and self-learning.

4. **Helping Others:** Being in a leadership position has taught me the importance of helping others complete their work. This not only fosters a collaborative environment but also enhances my understanding of the concepts as I explain them to others.

## Upscaling Project Management Skills

Leadership is not just about guiding others but also about continuous self-improvement. My role in CodeGNE has allowed me to refine my project management skills. Coordinating tasks, setting deadlines, and ensuring that the team stays on track are essential aspects of effective leadership that I am continually learning and implementing.

## Conclusion

Day 4 at CodeGNE has been transformative. It has provided me with a platform to hone my technical skills, embrace leadership responsibilities, and overcome challenges with determination. I am excited to continue this journey, leveraging my newfound skills to contribute effectively to my team and future projects. 

With each step, I am becoming more confident in my abilities and more enthusiastic about the endless possibilities that lie ahead in the field of computer science and engineering.
