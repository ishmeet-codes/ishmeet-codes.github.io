# My Experience @ GNDEC

## Day 1
My first day at GNDEC started with all the CSE and IT students assembling in the auditorium. The atmosphere was calm, and the stage was beautifully decorated. After waiting for about 30 minutes, the host invited the first speaker, Harpreet Mam. Her lecture made us feel like we were already a part of the GNDEC family.

Our Principal Sir then motivated us to make the best use of this platform. The NSET Director introduced us to the illustrious history of this institution, emphasizing its 100 years of shaping brilliant minds. He highlighted the first 36 years, which were dedicated to establishing the institute.

I learned an essential lesson: “Seize the opportunity; don’t wait for it to come to you.”

Next, the ADGP Officer shared invaluable insights about karma and the delayed rewards of good deeds. He spoke from experience for about an hour without any preparation, which was impressive. One piece of advice that stood out was: “Don’t be easily impressed; there’s always more to learn.”

Students who interacted and spoke up received chocolates. In the end, I missed out on chocolates but gained countless lessons, some the hard way. I resolved never to miss an opportunity again.



## Day 2

A new opportunity arose thanks to Dr. Arvind Dhingra. He helped me shed my reserved behavior and start interacting with others. He asked for 11 boys and 11 girls to come up on stage. Determined not to miss any opportunity, I joined them. We played a team strategy game and introduced ourselves to our peers.

Then, Dr. H.S. Rai, the Controller of Examination, spoke. His perspective on examinations was fascinating, viewing them as opportunities to shine.

Unexpectedly, Dr. H.S. Rai sought 10 students to work with him – not for him. I felt it was divine intervention when I got selected to be part of this group, which eventually grew to 50 members. From the second day of college, we began learning the latest technologies, an opportunity rarely seen elsewhere.

## Day 3

We learned Excel and ChatGPT in an exciting, hands-on class workshop organized by the Causmic Club. Instead of making a normal Excel sheet and performing calculations manually, we tried to do it with commands. I enjoyed it so much that I gave a video feedback after the lecture.

Later, we had a math session. Initially, recalling all the formulas was challenging, but I eventually got the hang of it and enjoyed the class. Our lecturer, a young assistant professor, was interactive and understanding.

Some of us attended a meeting of the CodeGNE club, a group that had grown to 50 members on Telegram.

# Day 4 at CodeGNE: Embracing Leadership and Overcoming Challenges

## Introduction

Day 4 at CodeGNE has been an exciting and rewarding experience. As a B.Tech student in Information Technologies at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, I am always eager to enhance my skills and take on new challenges. Today was particularly special as I continued to grow in my role as a leader and tackled several technical tasks.

## Stepping into Leadership

One of the most significant milestones today was being officially appointed as the first leader of my group. This role is a recognition of my skills and dedication, and it provides a valuable opportunity to develop project management and team leadership skills. Leading a group of talented peers and coordinating with the other five leaders appointed in our team has been a rewarding experience.

#### Understanding the Vision and Mission

In the hardware lab, our professors elaborated on the vision and mission of the IT department. The vision is particularly inspiring: **to train students from villages and transform them into professionals**. This commitment to empowering rural students underscores the department's dedication to inclusive education and social upliftment.

The mission emphasized preparing us to meet the challenges of the rapidly evolving tech industry through a comprehensive curriculum and hands-on experiences.

Each lab offered a glimpse into different facets of IT, from software development to network systems, and more. These visits were incredibly informative, allowing us to see the practical applications of our coursework and the resources available to us.

#### CodeGNE Meeting: Learning to Improvise

Later in the day, we attended a meeting of CodeGNE. This session was focused on the theme of improvisation. We learned various strategies and techniques to enhance our problem-solving skills and adaptability. The discussion provided valuable insights on how to think on our feet and make effective decisions in dynamic situations.

As I reflect on today's experiences, I am motivated to contribute to and benefit from the department's vision. I look forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, knowing that they are part of a well-defined path to success.



### Day 6: Universal Human Values, Canva Insights, and CodeGNE Leadership

Today marked the fifth day of my college journey, and it was packed with learning, interaction, and leadership.

Our first lecture of the day was on Universal Human Values, a subject that delves into the essence of what it means to live a fulfilling and content life. We explored the concept of happiness and the state of contentment, discussing how these states of mind influence our everyday actions and decisions. The session was enlightening, providing a fresh perspective on how we can achieve true happiness. We also shared real-life scenarios, which made the discussion more relatable and impactful.

#### Canva: Unlocking Creative Potential

After a refreshing break, we engaged in a peer interaction session where our seniors introduced us to Canva. Canva is a powerful tool for creating visually appealing designs, and the seniors did an excellent job explaining its features and potential uses. From designing posters to creating social media graphics, Canva offers a versatile platform for expressing creativity. This session was particularly beneficial for those of us looking to enhance our presentation and design skills.

#### CodeGNE Leadership: Empowering the Team

The day concluded with a leadership activity as part of my role in CodeGNE. As a leader, I, along with other group leaders, hosted a doubt session for our group members. This session was aimed at addressing any questions or concerns the members had regarding their projects and tasks. It was a rewarding experience to assist my peers, reinforcing the collaborative spirit of CodeGNE. Helping others not only solidified my understanding of the topics but also fostered a sense of community and support within our group.

### Reflections

Today's experiences highlighted the importance of values, creativity, and leadership in our academic and personal growth. The lecture on Universal Human Values reminded me that happiness and contentment are pivotal in shaping our lives. The Canva session unlocked new creative avenues, and the doubt session reinforced the significance of teamwork and guidance.

As I continue my journey, I am excited to apply these insights to my studies and extracurricular activities. Each day brings new opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute, and I am eager to embrace them all.

## Technical Learnings and Challenges

Today's journey in CodeGNE has been a treasure trove of technical knowledge. Here are some key learnings and challenges I encountered:

1. **Mastering GitHub:** Operating GitHub properly has been a game-changer. From version control to collaborative coding, GitHub has streamlined our workflow and enhanced our productivity.
   
2. **Markdown Language:** Learning Markdown has been incredibly useful. It has simplified the process of formatting text, creating documentation, and maintaining readability across various platforms.

3. **Pandoc Installation and Usage:** One of the more challenging yet fulfilling experiences was installing and using Pandoc. Despite facing initial difficulties, I was able to overcome them through perseverance and self-learning.

4. **Helping Others:** Being in a leadership position has taught me the importance of helping others complete their work. This not only fosters a collaborative environment but also enhances my understanding of the concepts as I explain them to others.

## Upscaling Project Management Skills

Leadership is not just about guiding others but also about continuous self-improvement. My role in CodeGNE has allowed me to refine my project management skills. Coordinating tasks, setting deadlines, and ensuring that the team stays on track are essential aspects of effective leadership that I am continually learning and implementing.
